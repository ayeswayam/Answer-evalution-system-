1,"What is the cell theory?","The cell theory states that all living things are made of cells,
cells are the basic unit of structure and function, and all cells come from pre-existing
cells.","The cell theory consists of three main principles: (1) All living organisms are
composed of one or more cells; (2) The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in
organisms; (3) All cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division."
2,"Explain photosynthesis.","Photosynthesis is when plants make food from sunlight using
chlorophyll.","Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria
convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This
process occurs in the chloroplasts and involves taking in carbon dioxide and water, and
releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light
energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2."
3,"Define Newton's Second Law of Motion.","F=ma which means force equals mass times
acceleration.","Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object is
directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
Mathematically, it is expressed as F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is
the acceleration. This law explains how the velocity of an object changes when a force is
applied to it."
4,"What caused World War I?","World War I started because Archduke Franz Ferdinand was
assassinated.","The causes of World War I were complex and multifaceted, including: (1)
Militarism: The major European powers were engaged in an arms race; (2) Alliance system:
Europe was divided into two opposing alliance networks; (3) Imperialism: Competition for
colonies and resources; (4) Nationalism: Growing patriotic sentiment and desire for
independence; (5) Immediate trigger: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of
Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, which set off a series of diplomatic and
military actions that led to the war."
5,"Describe the water cycle.","The water cycle is evaporation, condensation, and
precipitation.","The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the
continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It consists of
several key processes: (1) Evaporation: water changes from liquid to vapor due to solar
energy; (2) Transpiration: plants release water vapor; (3) Condensation: water vapor cools
and forms clouds; (4) Precipitation: water falls as rain, snow, etc.; (5) Infiltration: water soaks
into soil; (6) Runoff: water flows over land; (7) Collection: water gathers in bodies of water.
This cycle is driven by solar energy and gravity, and is essential for maintaining Earth's
ecosystems."
